Remember Ray Dalio's words. 
Remember this can make you fucking rich Eoin... 

1) Rollback and Migrate again adding more fields for Registration - FirstName, LastName, Email, Password, DOB... Console.log the Registration object to see how the DOB is sent to know how to add it to the DB.
2) Send data to the backend(locally) to register/login
3) Figure out how to upload pictures to the backend remembering most people will be using phones.
